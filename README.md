Hello! This is my updated portfolio inside it are a few of the homework assignments and one project I've been working on.

 # Project 1 - Stock Monitor 
  This was the first group project of the course. In this group project we decided to make an app where someone could manage stocks and see what their real time investments were depending on a few inputs they gave the app. It utilized a couple API's that provided the stock data and some news article data to "make informed investments" based on the stock data that was provided. We used Firebase a realtime database to store the data. We also added a few visual aids to our app because we all like when data is presented in graphs.

 # Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia Trivia Game

  I made a simple trivia game that was focusing on the use of timers. Its a fun multiple choice quiz that asked you Its Always Sunny trivia questions. There is a timer indicating how much time you have to finish the quiz. When you answer all of the questions or when the timer runs out the page will show you how many questions you got correct, missed and didn't answer. I really enjoyed the theme I chose for this assignment. 
  
# Train Scheduler

  This assignment was a train schedule app that used Firebase to store data on the arrival and departure of trains. The app takes the data and adds moment.js to give you real-time arrival times and wait times on different trains you decided to input into the app.
  
 # Rupee Collector

  In this assignment we had to make a simple web based game that focused on jQuery. You will be givin a random number to start the game. Four rupees are displayed representing four random numbers that are unknown to the player. Clicking a rupee will add to the current score essentially revealing how much that rupee is worth. The goal is to get your score to match the number generated at the beginning of the game.
