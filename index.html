                    <p>This was the first group project of the course. In this group project we decided to make an app
                        where someone could manage stocks and see what their real time investments were depending on a
                        few inputs they gave the app. It utilized a couple API's that provided the stock data and some
                        news article data to "make informed investments" based on the stock data that was provided. We
                        used Firebase a realtime database to store the data. We also added a few visual aids to our app
                        because we all like when data is presented in graphs.</p>

                        I made a simple trivia game that was focusing on the use
                        of timers. Its a fun multiple choice quiz that asked you Its Always Sunny trivia questions.
                        There is a timer indicating how much time you have to finish the quiz. When you answer all of
                        the questions or when the timer runs out the page will show you how many questions you got
                        correct, missed and didn't answer. I really enjoyed the theme I chose for this assignment.</p>

                    <p>
                        This assignment was a train schedule app that used Firebase to store data on the arrival and
                        departure of trains. The app takes the data and adds moment.js to give you real-time arrival
                        times and wait times on different trains you decided to input into the app.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In this assignment we had to make a simple web based game that focused on jQuery. You will be
                        givin a random number to start the game. Four rupees are displayed representing four random
                        numbers that are unknown to the player. Clicking a rupee will add to the current score
                        essentially revealing how much that rupee is worth. The goal is to get your score to match the
                        number generated at the beginning of the game.
